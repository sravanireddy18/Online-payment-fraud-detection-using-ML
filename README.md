Project Title: Online payment fraud detection using machine learning

Description

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model predicts outcomes based on a given dataset and demonstrates data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.


Features:

Data preprocessing and visualization.


Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.

Model evaluation with accuracy scoring.

Files Included:

data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

model.py: Python script implementing the Decision Tree Classifier.

Requirements:

Python 3.8+

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib (if visualization is included)
